Description:
Buxton Point is an award winning modern and affordable housing project in Mombasa which is being done through a partnership between GulfCap Real Estate and the County Government of Mombasa. 

Background:
The right to housing is embedded in the Constitution of Kenya, which provides that every person has the right to accessible and adequate housing. With Kenya’s growing economy and one of the fastest-growing urbanisation rates in the continent, the demand for housing has never been greater.
